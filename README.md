# Title: Classic ML Algorithms labs in Made
## Description:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Laboratory Works of Classical Machine Learning Algorithms! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms. Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks, code examples that guide you through the step-by-step implementation and evaluation of classic ML algorithms.

## Project Overview:
In this repository, we dive into the core concepts of classical machine learning, exploring well-known algorithms that form the foundation of modern data analysis and predictive modeling. Each laboratory work is designed to introduce you to a specific algorithm and provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

## Key Features:
- Implementation of Classical ML Algorithms: Covering popular algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and more.
 - Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean, transform, and prepare data for training and testing the ML models.
 - Model Evaluation: Utilizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves to assess algorithm performance.
 - Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring methods to optimize model parameters for improved results.
 -  Interactive Jupyter Notebooks: Hands-on exercises and practical examples for easy learning and experimentation.
